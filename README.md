# Credit Risk Prediction and Loan Classification Using Machine Learning
Project Based-Internship (PBI) Data Scientist - id/x Partners x Rakamin Academy

As the final task of my internship contract as a Data Scientist Intern at ID/X Partners, I am responsible for developing a credit risk prediction model for a lending company using Python. In this project, I collaborate with various departments to process the loan dataset, both accepted and rejected loans, to build an end-to-end solution that aligns with Data Science methodologies. Besides focusing on the technical aspects of modeling, I am also creating clear and communicative visual media to effectively present this strategic solution to the client.
